# Example for command and control of customer accounts.

## Archived

This example repository is not going to be updated with `go.sum` updates for
security updates, so we've archived it.

If you need to make changes, after unarchiving please start with dependency
updates.

## Original

We fix the number of exports for the root account but allow any number of
customer accounts to be queried.

See the `srv.conf` file for the server setup.

```bash
# To run
go run main.go
```
